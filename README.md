# sparql-base

You should have a form (WinForm) with:
textBox for output
3 buttons: show all Classes, show all Instances, show all properties (Datatype- and ObjectProperties separately)
user interface for SPARQL forming (ex. 3 ComboBoxes + button “Run SPARQL”)
don’t send me this project -- use practice classes and consultations to show me.
